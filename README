Nagios Plugins
===============

This project provides base classes written in Python to help write Nagios/Icinga plugins.

Plugins return data in perfdata format.

Creating a new plugin is quite simple - just subclass the NagiosPlugin object, then create a method to
handle parsing command line arguments, and a new class that retrieves the data. See check_mysql_stats.py
as an example.
